# 2048 PowerPlay 🎮

Welcome to **2048 PowerPlay**, a SwiftUI-based version of the classic 2048 puzzle game, with added features for a fresh experience! The goal is simple: combine tiles with the same numbers to reach the 2048 tile or even beyond! 🚀

## Features ✨
- **Swipe controls:** Use gestures to move the tiles (up, down, left, right) and merge them.
- **Score System:** Keep track of your current score and beat your **Best Score** displayed at the top.
- **Resume Game:** Close the app? No worries! Your game automatically saves, allowing you to pick up right where you left off.
- **SwiftUI Implementation:** Built using modern SwiftUI for smooth performance and a sleek UI.
- **Iconic 2048 Look:** UI closely resembles the classic 2048 experience for nostalgic fans, with some PowerPlay twists.

## How to Play 🎮
- Swipe in any direction (up, down, left, or right) to move the tiles.
- When two tiles of the same number collide, they merge into one and double their value.
- Try to reach the **2048** tile to win the game, but you can continue playing to get even higher scores!
- Keep an eye on your **Best Score** at the top of the screen, and try to beat it!

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **SwiftUI**: The game is entirely developed using SwiftUI for modern, declarative UI development.
- **Core Data**: Game progress and scores are saved using Core Data, allowing users to resume the game after app closure.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Leveraging the MVVM pattern for cleaner, more modular code.

## Roadmap 🚀
Future improvements may include:
- **Undo functionality** to go back one move.
- **Dark Mode Support** for seamless gameplay in all lighting conditions.
- **Multiple Themes** to customize your game’s look and feel.
